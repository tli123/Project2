What did you learn by doing this assignment?

	I learned how to use the java GUI library to a good extent, including layout, 
	different GUI objects and more.

What was easy about this assignment?
     	 Everything besides the GUI, MVC portion was fairly straightforward.

What was harder than you originally thought?

	The GUI was more of a pain than I thought. Getting the MVC framework to work as 
	intended took longer amount of time than allocated.

What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

	The documentation online was vague in some ways. Perhaps show a compiled 
	finished product in class or online to clear up uncertainties.

What would you have liked to do in this assignment?
         Networking.

What other issues would you like to discuss?
     	LGBT issues.

What did you learn by doing this assignment?

     	 I learned to fully utilize the MVC instead of stashing everything into the gui.

What was easy about this assignment?
     	 
	 Laying out the GUI and the models were pretty easy.

What was harder than you originally thought?

	The states were the harder to implement than I anticipated. I needed more states than I
	thought I needed.

What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

     	 Be more concise with the instructions. The instructions were vague at points,
	 and sometimes delayed our coding time because of our lack of understanding.

What would you have liked to do in this assignment?
 
	I would have liked to be a little fancier with the ATM in terms of buttons other
	features, but project constraints prevented me from doing so.

What other issues would you like to discuss?

     	   There weren't any glaring issues that weren't mentioned before, but more introduction
	   to MVC might have helped us understand the project better.
